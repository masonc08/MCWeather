# MCWeather
Greetings!

This repository holds MCWeather, a JavaScript program I worked on throughout highschoool. 
MCWeather uses the [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) library for some basic display functions.

MCWeather will report the current temperature of any city in the world, and gather forecasted weather information within the next week. You can choose to search for a temperature range, and MCWeather will tell you exactly which date and hour your specified temperature range will occour on!

This was mainly a project for me to apply concepts learned throughout highschool, and see if I could generate a useful tool with what I knew back then. I combined together object-oriented-programming, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, arrays, and loops. I also for the first time tried using an API ([OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)), which was lots of fun. I learned to extract data from the JSON files it generated, and loaded the data into arrays.

Overall, this project was really fun to work on, and I learned a lot along the way, all thanks to StackOverflow.
